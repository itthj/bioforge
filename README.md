# BioForge

Agentic AI bioinformatics platform. Current state: Phase 2 + Phase 3 in progress — full plan→approval→execute→critique→replan loop with SSE streaming, a React frontend that renders the live trace, and a 15-tool registry covering sequence basics, CRISPR design / scoring / off-targets / NHEJ outcomes / integrated edit reports, PCR primer design (primer3), VCF parsing, and project memory. Projects + persistent project memory with audit/edit endpoints. Structured-output planner and critic via Anthropic forced tool-use. OpenTelemetry tracing on every agent run. CI runs ruff + pytest + the frontend build on every push. Local BLAST+ supported alongside the remote NCBI default. The full stack runs via `docker compose up`.

**New here?** See [`docs/DEMO.md`](docs/DEMO.md) for an end-to-end walkthrough and the "what's real vs honestly-gated" scorecard — the integrity (grounding / benchmarking / calibration / provenance) is the product, and that doc states exactly which numbers are real measurements.

## Quickstart

### Docker (one command)

```powershell
# Set your Anthropic API key in a .env beside docker-compose.yml first.
# Then:
docker compose up --build
```

Open http://localhost:5173. The backend lives in the `bioforge-backend` container on the compose network; the SQLite DB persists in the named volume `bioforge-data`. To wipe state: `docker compose down -v`.

### Backend

```powershell
# from the repo root
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e ".[dev]"
copy .env.example .env
# edit .env and set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# regenerate test fixtures (one-time, requires network + BIOFORGE_ENTREZ_EMAIL set)
python backend/tests/fixtures/regenerate.py

# run tests (no API key needed — Anthropic is mocked)
pytest

# start the server
uvicorn bioforge.main:app --app-dir backend/src --reload
```

### Frontend (Vite dev server)

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install            # first run only
npm run dev            # serves on http://localhost:5173 with proxy to backend on :8000
npm test               # vitest run — component tests against happy-dom
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit, strict mode
npm run build          # production bundle in dist/
```

Open http://localhost:5173 — type a goal, watch the agent reason. The dev server proxies `/agent`, `/projects`, `/traces`, `/health` to the backend so the SPA uses relative URLs.

Then in another shell:

```powershell
# trivial — planner short-circuits, executor calls gc_content, no critic
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/run -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"goal\":\"GC content of ATGCATGC\"}"

# multi-step — planner emits 2-step plan, executor chains tools, critic evaluates
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/run -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"goal\":\"What is the GC content of the reverse complement of ATGCATGC?\"}"

# expensive — BLAST pauses for approval; response carries trace_id + pending_plan
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/run -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"goal\":\"BLAST ATGCATGCATGCATGCATGC against nt and tell me the top hit\"}"
# → status=pending_approval; copy the trace_id from the response, then approve:
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/<TRACE_ID>/approve -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"approved\":true}"
# or cancel without running BLAST:
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/<TRACE_ID>/approve -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"approved\":false}"
```

### Streaming (SSE)

Use the `*/stream` variants to see steps as they happen — essential for BLAST runs:

```powershell
# -N disables curl's output buffering; required to see events as they arrive
curl.exe -N -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/run/stream -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"goal\":\"GC content of the reverse complement of ATGCATGC\"}"

# Streaming approve — watch BLAST progress live after approval
curl.exe -N -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/<TRACE_ID>/approve/stream -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"approved\":true}"
```

Each event is one `event: <name>\ndata: <json>\n\n` block. Event types:

- `step` — one `AgentStep` (plan / tool_call / critique / final / approval_requested / etc.)
- `done` — final summary `{trace_id, status, response_text, usage, pending_plan?, approval_reasons?}`
- `error` — transport-level error (the agent loop's own errors arrive as `tool_error` step events)
- Comment lines `: keepalive` flush every ~15s to keep proxies from closing the connection

> **Database migrations**: schema changes now ship as Alembic revisions in `backend/alembic/versions/`. `init_db()` runs `alembic upgrade head` at FastAPI startup, so the dev path stays one-command. To work with migrations directly:
>
> ```powershell
> cd backend
> $env:BIOFORGE_DB_URL = "sqlite+aiosqlite:///./bioforge.db"
> ..\.venv\Scripts\alembic.exe revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"  # after editing a model
> ..\.venv\Scripts\alembic.exe upgrade head                                    # apply
> ..\.venv\Scripts\alembic.exe downgrade -1                                    # revert one
> ```
>
> A CI test (`test_migrations.py`) applies the full chain to an empty DB and asserts the resulting schema matches `Base.metadata` — catches model-vs-migration drift before merge.

### CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push + PR to `main`:
  - **backend** — pip install, `ruff check backend/`, `pytest -v` (online-marker tests excluded by `pyproject.toml`'s `addopts`)
  - **frontend** — `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`
  - Jobs run in parallel; concurrency cancels superseded refs to save minutes.

`.github/workflows/nightly.yml` runs weekly (Mondays 06:00 UTC) and on manual dispatch:
  - Regenerates committed fixtures from live NCBI (`regenerate.py`)
  - Runs the `-m online` test suite — catches upstream API drift (renamed accession, schema change, deprecated endpoint) before users do
  - Uploads regenerated fixtures as an artifact on failure so you can diff what NCBI changed

### OpenTelemetry export

Tracing is disabled by default. Enable it when you want spans for agent runs, LLM calls, and tool calls:

```powershell
# Console spans for local debugging
$env:BIOFORGE_OTEL_ENABLED = "true"
$env:BIOFORGE_OTEL_EXPORTER = "console"

# OTLP/HTTP export to a local collector, Jaeger, Honeycomb, Tempo, etc.
$env:BIOFORGE_OTEL_ENABLED = "true"
$env:BIOFORGE_OTEL_EXPORTER = "otlp"
$env:BIOFORGE_OTEL_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:4318/v1/traces"
$env:BIOFORGE_OTEL_HEADERS = "authorization=Bearer <token>"  # optional key=value,key2=value2
```

`BIOFORGE_OTEL_EXPORTER=none` installs a provider without exporting. That is mainly for tests and local instrumentation checks.

### Projects + memory

Every run is scoped to a `project_id` (default: `"default-project"`, auto-created on startup). Each project has its own memory store the agent can read via `recall_memory` and write via `remember`. The user can inspect and edit memory via the `/projects/{id}/memory` API.

```powershell
# Create a project
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8000/projects -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"id\":\"crispr-2026\",\"name\":\"CRISPR screen 2026\",\"organism\":\"Homo sapiens\",\"reference_genome\":\"GRCh38\"}"

# Run an agent goal scoped to that project — the planner sees the project's organism + memory entries
curl.exe -N -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/run/stream -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"goal\":\"GC content of ATGCATGC\",\"project_id\":\"crispr-2026\"}"

# Inspect what the agent has remembered
curl.exe http://localhost:8000/projects/crispr-2026/memory

# Edit / override a memory entry as the user
curl.exe -X PUT http://localhost:8000/projects/crispr-2026/memory/preferred_organism -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"value\":\"Mus musculus\",\"kind\":\"preference\"}"
```

## Architecture notes

- **Structured outputs via forced tool-use.** Planner and critic each define a single tool (`submit_plan`, `submit_verdict`) whose `input_schema` IS the Pydantic model. `tool_choice={"type":"tool","name":...}` forces the call. This is the idiomatic way to get reliable structured JSON from the Anthropic API.
- **Approval gate is plan-level, not loop-level.** Once a plan is approved, the executor runs without further pauses. Replans inherit the original approval scope — the replanner prompt is responsible for staying inside the approved tool set.
- **Manual tool-use loop**, not the SDK's beta tool runner — gives control over the planner / executor / critic split. The executor never sees `submit_plan` or `submit_verdict`; the planner/critic never see bio tools.
- **Trivial plans short-circuit the critic.** Paying for critic evaluation on "GC content of ATGC" is wasted tokens.
- **One replan attempt, then honest failure.** If the critic rejects both attempts, the response includes the second draft + a "remaining concerns" note. No silent loops, no fabrication.
- **Prompt caching markers** on the last tool definition + last system block; activate automatically once the prefix crosses Sonnet 4.6's 2048-token minimum.
- **Every persisted row carries `project_id`** (hardcoded to `default-project` until project CRUD lands).
- **Trace step types**: `plan` / `replan` / `approval_requested` / `approval_decision` / `llm_call` / `tool_call` / `tool_error` / `refusal` / `critique` / `final`. Each carries its own structured payload.
- **BLAST is remote-only** for now (NCBI public API via `Bio.Blast.NCBIWWW`, wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread`). Local BLAST+ binary integration and a job queue (Celery) are deferred until the synchronous round-trip becomes the bottleneck.
- **Streaming via `on_step` callback.** Every step-producing function in the agent loop accepts `on_step: Callable[[AgentStep], Awaitable[None]]`. The SSE endpoints plug a queue-backed callback in and drain it into `text/event-stream`. Default `None` preserves the synchronous JSON path. Callback errors are swallowed so a disconnected SSE client doesn't abort the agent run.
- **Memory injected into the planner, NOT the system prompt.** System prompt is cached (Anthropic prompt-caching); injecting per-project context there would break the cache. Instead memory rides on the planner's user message, which is per-run anyway. `load_relevant_memory()` returns the empty string when there's nothing useful, so the planner's input stays unchanged for empty projects.
- **Memory tools reach DB via ContextVars, not parameters.** `recall_memory` and `remember` read `get_current_project_id()` / `get_current_db_session()` set by `AgentContextScope` in the API layer. Bio tools that don't need DB access ignore the ContextVars entirely. Tools called outside a scope raise `ToolError` rather than silently no-op'ing.
- Tests use committed fixtures generated by `tests/fixtures/regenerate.py`. Online suite (`pytest -m online`) hits real APIs and is deselected by default.
